Most challenging part for me was time management. I got lost between assignments, work and errands. The challenge from design part was trying to put so many design branches in an ordered way, also trying to keep simple with too many information was another challenge. From I managed to code, the only challenge was dropdown menu for mobile and tablet versions of the web page. Also, small continous mistakes like forgetting to write "px" near number while making a calculation with calc() function was time consuming.
I think if I continue to code, the "life story" in my About Me page would need too many CSS Frameworks, while I'm planning to finish this web site after submitting, I believe I am going to have too many struggles when I am doing that part.
I wish I knew coding in JavaScript.
